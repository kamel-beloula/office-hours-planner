# Module 7 Challenge Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Title

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the working day.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

IT IS DONE when

* The current day is displayed at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Timeblocks are present for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Each timeblock is colour-coded based on past, present and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* A user is allowed to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
* The event is saved in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Events persist between refreshes of a page.

## Tasks Completed

* Implemented the required solution in the browser featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Moment.js
* Divided the implementation into multiple logical functions
* Uses localStorage to maintain the schedule in a JSON serialised array
* Implemented a clock using a setInterval and Moment.js for date and time utilities
* Implemented schedule rows using jQuery and Bootstrap
* Implemented a click event handler using jQuery

## Challenges / Things I learnt

* Use of Moment.js date and time utilities and format method
* Use of jQuery to retrieve and build DoM elements
* Use of localStorage and JSON.stringify and JSON.parse methods, which took me a while.
